# OpenComputer Docs Rewrite Plan

## Guiding Principles

1. **Single sidebar, no tabs.** Every page lives in one navigation tree.
2. **Entity-first.** Pages organized around things the user encounters (sandboxes, agents, checkpoints, templates), not by SDK or abstract category. Each entity page is self-contained: what it is, how to use it, full API reference.
3. **Three-tab examples.** Every code example wraps in tabs: TypeScript / Python / HTTP API (where applicable). The user picks their preferred surface once and sees it everywhere. Some examples are SDK-only (no HTTP equivalent for streaming); some are HTTP-only (auth headers). Use judgement — include a tab only when it adds value.
4. **Quality over quantity.** If it can be said in fewer words, it should be. No filler sections. Every page earns its place.
5. **Entity → Example → Reference** flow on each page. Open with what the entity *is* (2-3 sentences), show a working code example, then provide the full API reference below.
6. **Code-forward.** The first thing on every entity page (after the short explanation) should be a working code example. Parameters and types come after.
7. **Reference section is exhaustive.** The Agents/Sandboxes pages teach with curated examples. The Reference pages document every endpoint, method, type, and parameter — the source of truth when the entity pages aren't enough.
8. **Honest about gaps.** Don't document features that don't exist yet. Mark experimental/beta features clearly.

## Current State Assessment

### What exists (30 .mdx files)
- Introduction + Quickstart (solid onboarding)
- 3 feature pages: Agents, Running Commands, Working with Files
- 8 TypeScript SDK pages (separate tab)
- 8 Python SDK pages (separate tab, mirrors TS)
- 7 CLI reference pages (separate tab)
- 2 guides (Lovable clone, Agent Skill)

### Key problems
1. **Tab separation creates duplication.** "Running Commands" exists as a feature page, a TS SDK page, a Python SDK page, and a CLI page. Four places for one concept.
2. **No conceptual foundation.** Docs jump straight to API calls without explaining what a sandbox *is*, its lifecycle, resource model, or how persistence works.
3. **Missing critical content.** No sandbox specs (OS, storage, network), no error reference, no troubleshooting, no architecture overview.
4. **SDK/code gaps.** `resume` in Agent sessions, `maxRunAfterDisconnect` in exec, hibernation semantics, preview URL domain verification — all in code but undocumented.
5. **Inconsistent API naming between SDKs.** `sandbox.exec` vs `sandbox.commands` (deprecated alias still used in Python quickstart examples).

---

## Proposed Structure

The two top-level entities are **Agents** (the primary use case — Claude running inside sandboxes) and **Sandboxes** (the compute primitive). Agents come first because that's why most users are here. Everything else — files, checkpoints, templates, etc. — are sub-entities scoped under their parent. Directory structure mirrors navigation groups.

### Why this structure

- **Agents first.** This is the headline feature — most users land here to run Claude inside sandboxes. Putting Agents right after Getting Started matches the reader's intent.
- **Agents get depth.** Four pages mirror the Sandboxes pattern: an overview page explaining what agents are, then dedicated pages for events (the output you consume), tools (configuring what agents can do), and multi-turn (conversations that span sessions). Each page earns its place by covering a distinct concern.
- **Sandboxes group** contains the sandbox entity page plus everything you do with a sandbox (run commands, work with files, open terminals, create checkpoints, build templates, expose URLs).
- **Directory = group.** `agents/`, `sandboxes/`, `cli/`, `guides/` — folder structure mirrors navigation. No orphan files at the root (except Getting Started and Resources).
- **No "Concepts" section.** Each entity page opens with what it is and why it exists, then shows the API.
- **No "Features" section.** The sidebar groups tell you what things *are*.

## Page-by-Page Specification

### Getting Started

#### `introduction.mdx` — REWRITE

**Goal:** Explain what OpenComputer is, who it's for, and why it exists. In 60 seconds a reader should know if this product is relevant to them.

**Structure:**
1. One-sentence tagline (cloud sandboxes for AI agents)
2. 3-4 sentence explanation: what a sandbox is, what makes it different from containers/serverless (persistent, full Linux VM, hibernates, checkpoints)
3. Feature cards (keep existing 4, tighten copy):
   - Claude Agent SDK built in
   - Long-running (hours/days, not minutes)
   - Checkpoint/fork like git branches
   - Full Linux VM (not a container)
4. Install (CodeGroup: npm + pip + CLI)
5. Minimal example: create sandbox → run agent → get result (TS + Python side by side)
6. Next steps cards → Quickstart, Agents, Sandboxes

**Changes from current:** Add install for CLI. Tighten copy. Add "Full Linux VM" card. Remove "Run agent tasks easily" card (redundant with Agent SDK card).

#### `quickstart.mdx` — REWRITE

**Goal:** Working code in 5 minutes. Three examples of increasing complexity.

**Structure:**
1. Prerequisites: API key + SDK installed (link to intro for install)
2. Set API key (env var)
3. **Example 1: Run a command** — Simplest possible thing. Create sandbox, run `echo`, print output, kill. (TS + Python)
4. **Example 2: Run an agent** — Create sandbox, `agent.start()` with a real task, stream events. (TS + Python)
5. **Example 3: Checkpoint and fork** — Create sandbox, do work, checkpoint, fork, verify state. (TS + Python)
6. Next steps: link to Agents (deep dive), Sandboxes (the primitive), Checkpoints (persistence)

**Changes from current:** Add command example before agent example (simpler onramp). Add checkpoint example. Fix Python quickstart (currently shows `sandbox.commands.run` instead of agent example — mismatch with TS).

---

### Entity Pages

Each entity page follows this template:
1. **What is this** — 2-3 sentences explaining the entity for someone who's never seen it
2. **Primary code example** in tabs (TypeScript / Python / HTTP API where applicable)
3. **API reference** with `<ParamField>` for each method
4. **Additional examples** (also tabbed where applicable)
5. **Related** — links to CLI equivalent, reference pages, and related entity pages

### Agents (`agents/`)

#### `agents/overview.mdx` — REWRITE (entity page)

**Goal:** Explain what agent sessions are, how they work, and get the reader to a working agent in 60 seconds.

**Structure:**
1. **What is an agent session** — A Claude Agent SDK instance running inside a sandbox. The agent has full access to the sandbox's filesystem and shell. You send it a prompt, it works autonomously — writing files, running commands, iterating on errors — and streams events back as it goes.
2. **Quick example:** `sandbox.agent.start()` with event handling (TS + Python CodeGroup) — the simplest working agent
3. **How it works** — brief (3-4 sentences): the SDK spawns Claude inside the sandbox VM, Claude gets bash/file tools, it works in a loop (think → act → observe), events stream back to your code via WebSocket.
4. **`sandbox.agent.start(opts)`** — full param reference:
   - prompt, model, systemPrompt, allowedTools, permissionMode, maxTurns, cwd, mcpServers, resume, onEvent, onError, onExit
5. **AgentSession** — properties and methods table:
   - sessionId, done, sendPrompt, interrupt, configure, kill, close
   - **Python-specific:** `collect_events()`, `wait()`
6. **Quick links** to sub-pages: Events, Tools, Multi-turn

**Absorbs content from:** current `agents.mdx`, `sdks/typescript/agent.mdx` (overview parts), `sdks/python/agent.mdx` (overview parts).

#### `agents/events.mdx` — NEW

**Goal:** Complete reference for understanding what comes back from an agent session. A developer should be able to look at any event and know exactly what it means and how to handle it.

**Structure:**
1. Brief intro: agent sessions emit a stream of typed events via the `onEvent` callback. Each event has a `type` field.
2. **Event lifecycle** — typical order of events for a successful session:
   `ready → configured → assistant → tool_use_summary → assistant → ... → result → turn_complete`
3. **Event reference** — one subsection per event type, each with:
   - What it means
   - When it fires
   - Fields/payload
   - Code example showing how to handle it
   - Event types: `ready`, `configured`, `assistant`, `tool_use_summary`, `system`, `result`, `turn_complete`, `interrupted`, `error`
4. **Filtering events** — practical patterns: logging only assistant messages, capturing the final result, progress indicators
5. **Error handling** — `error` events vs `onError` (stderr) vs rejected promises. When each fires and how to respond.

#### `agents/tools.mdx` — NEW

**Goal:** Explain how to configure what tools an agent can use, including MCP servers for custom capabilities.

**Structure:**
1. **Default tools** — what the agent can do out of the box (bash, file read/write, Python). Brief explanation of `allowedTools` param.
2. **MCP servers** — the main event on this page. What MCP is (one sentence), then how to configure it:
   - `mcpServers` param structure: `Record<string, { command, args?, env? }>`
   - Example: SQLite database tool
   - Example: custom API tool
   - How MCP servers run (spawned inside the sandbox, agent discovers tools via protocol)
3. **`systemPrompt`** — how to steer agent behavior with custom instructions
4. **`permissionMode`** — what it controls, available values
5. **`maxTurns`** — limiting agent iterations

#### `agents/multi-turn.mdx` — NEW

**Goal:** Everything about conversations that go beyond a single prompt — follow-ups, resuming across sessions, and managing running sessions.

**Structure:**
1. **Follow-up prompts** — `session.sendPrompt(text)` to continue a conversation within the same session
   - Example: start a task, wait for completion, send follow-up
2. **Resuming across sessions** — `resume` parameter in `agent.start()`
   - How it works: capture `claude_session_id` from `turn_complete` event, pass it as `resume` in a new `agent.start()` call
   - Example: save session ID, create new sandbox from checkpoint, resume conversation
   - **NEW: first time this is documented**
3. **Interrupting** — `session.interrupt()` to stop the current turn
4. **Reconfiguring mid-session** — `session.configure()` to change model, tools, etc.
5. **Managing sessions:**
   - `sandbox.agent.list()` — list active sessions
   - `sandbox.agent.attach(sessionId)` — reconnect to a running session (get events you missed)
   - When to use attach vs resume
6. **Note:** Agent sessions are SDK-only (no CLI command yet)

---

### Sandboxes (`sandboxes/`)

#### `sandboxes/overview.mdx` — NEW (entity page)

**Goal:** The definitive page for understanding and working with the sandbox primitive. Concept + lifecycle + full SDK API for sandbox management.

**Structure:**
1. **What is a sandbox** — A full Linux virtual machine in the cloud. Each sandbox is an isolated environment with its own filesystem, network, and processes. Think of it as a laptop that sleeps when idle and wakes instantly when you need it.
2. **Quick example:** create → run command → kill (TS + Python CodeGroup)
3. **Specs table:**
   - OS: Ubuntu-based Linux
   - Default CPU: 1 vCPU (configurable up to 4 via `cpuCount`)
   - Default memory: 512MB (configurable up to 2GB via `memoryMB`)
   - Storage: 20GB workspace
   - Network: full outbound internet access
   - Pre-installed: Python 3, Node.js, common CLI tools
4. **Creating a sandbox** — `Sandbox.create(opts)` with full param reference:
   - template, timeout, apiKey, apiUrl, envs, metadata, cpuCount, memoryMB
5. **Connecting to an existing sandbox** — `Sandbox.connect(sandboxId)`
6. **Sandbox lifecycle:**
   - Status states: `creating → running → hibernated → killed`
   - Lifecycle diagram (text-based)
   - Rolling timeout: resets on every operation, default 300s
   - What happens on timeout: auto-hibernate if possible, else kill
7. **Hibernation & wake** — `sandbox.hibernate()`, `sandbox.wake()`
   - Like closing a laptop lid: memory + disk snapshotted, sandbox ID stays the same
   - Resume in seconds, no cost while hibernated
   - Auto-triggered on idle timeout
   - Difference from checkpoints: hibernation is transparent resume, checkpoints are named snapshots you fork from
8. **Other methods** — `kill()`, `isRunning()`, `setTimeout()`
9. **Sandbox properties** — sandboxId, agent, exec, files, pty

**Absorbs content from:** `sdks/typescript/sandbox.mdx`, `sdks/python/sandbox.mdx`.

#### `sandboxes/running-commands.mdx` — REWRITE

**Structure:**
1. Brief intro: two modes for running shell commands — `run()` (wait for result) and `start()` (streaming/async)
2. **Quick commands: `sandbox.exec.run()`** — CodeGroup TS + Python
   - Full param reference (command, timeout, env, cwd)
   - ProcessResult table
   - Examples: cwd, env vars, timeout, chaining
3. **Async commands: `sandbox.exec.start()`** — CodeGroup TS + Python
   - Full param reference (command, args, env, cwd, timeout, maxRunAfterDisconnect, onStdout, onStderr, onExit)
   - **NEW: document `maxRunAfterDisconnect`** — process continues running N seconds after WebSocket disconnect
   - ExecSession table (sessionId, done, sendStdin, kill, close)
4. **Managing sessions:**
   - `sandbox.exec.list()` — list running sessions
   - `sandbox.exec.attach()` — reconnect to running session
   - `sandbox.exec.kill()` — kill a session
5. Examples: dev server, long-running process, reconnect pattern

**Key improvement:** Use `sandbox.exec.*` consistently (not `sandbox.commands`). Document `maxRunAfterDisconnect`. Add session management.

#### `sandboxes/working-with-files.mdx` — REWRITE

**Structure:** Keep current structure — it's already good. Add CodeGroup for all examples.
1. Reading files (read, readBytes)
2. Writing files (write — text and binary)
3. Listing directories (list, EntryInfo)
4. Managing files (makeDir, remove, exists)
5. Examples: upload & run script, copy files

**Minimal changes needed.** Merge TS/Python into CodeGroups and ensure consistency.

#### `sandboxes/interactive-terminals.mdx` — NEW (promote from SDK-only)

**Structure:**
1. **What is a PTY session** — A full interactive terminal inside the sandbox, like SSH but over WebSocket. Supports colors, resize, full-screen apps (vim, top).
2. Create a PTY session (TS + Python CodeGroup)
3. PtyOpts reference (cols, rows, onOutput)
4. PtySession methods (send, close)
5. Examples: run interactive commands, pipe stdin
6. CLI equivalent: `oc shell <sandbox-id>`

#### `sandboxes/checkpoints.mdx` — REWRITE (entity page)

**Structure:**
1. **What is a checkpoint** — A named snapshot of a running sandbox's full state (memory, disk, processes). Create a checkpoint, then fork new sandboxes from it — each fork starts exactly where the checkpoint left off. Think of it like git commits for VMs.
2. Quick example: create checkpoint → fork → verify state (TS + Python CodeGroup)
3. **How checkpoints differ from hibernation:**
   - Hibernation pauses and resumes the *same* sandbox
   - Checkpoints create *new* sandboxes from a saved state
   - A sandbox can have many checkpoints; hibernation is a single pause/resume
4. **API reference:**
   - `sandbox.createCheckpoint(name)` — create
   - `sandbox.listCheckpoints()` — list
   - `Sandbox.createFromCheckpoint(id)` — fork a new sandbox
   - `sandbox.restoreCheckpoint(id)` — revert in-place
   - `sandbox.deleteCheckpoint(id)` — delete
5. CheckpointInfo structure (id, name, status, sandboxId, createdAt)
6. Status: `processing → ready`
7. Examples: checkpoint before risky operation, fork for parallel exploration

#### `sandboxes/templates.mdx` — REWRITE (entity page)

**Structure:**
1. **What is a template** — A pre-built base image that sandboxes start from. The `default` template includes Ubuntu, Python, and Node.js. Build custom templates from Dockerfiles to skip setup time.
2. Quick example: build template → create sandbox from it (TS + Python CodeGroup)
3. **Default template** — what's pre-installed (derive from `Dockerfile.default`)
4. **API reference:**
   - `Template.build(name, dockerfile)` — build from Dockerfile
   - `Template.list()` — list available
   - `Template.get(name)` — get details
   - `Template.delete(name)` — delete
   - Using in `Sandbox.create({ template: "my-template" })`
5. TemplateInfo structure
6. Example: template with specific language/framework pre-installed

#### `sandboxes/patches.mdx` — REWRITE (entity page)

**Structure:**
1. **What is a patch** — A shell script attached to a checkpoint that runs every time a sandbox is forked from that checkpoint. Use patches to inject configuration, update dependencies, or customize state at fork time without modifying the checkpoint itself.
2. Quick example: create patch on checkpoint (TS + Python CodeGroup)
3. **API reference:**
   - `Sandbox.createCheckpointPatch(checkpointId, { script, description })`
   - `Sandbox.listCheckpointPatches(checkpointId)`
   - `Sandbox.deleteCheckpointPatch(checkpointId, patchId)`
4. When patches run (table: fork = yes, restore = yes/no)
5. Execution order: patches run in sequence order
6. Failure handling: what happens if a patch script fails
7. Example: inject API keys, update packages at fork time

#### `sandboxes/preview-urls.mdx` — NEW (entity page)

**Structure:**
1. **What is a preview URL** — A public HTTPS URL that exposes a port inside your sandbox to the internet. Start a web server on port 3000 in your sandbox, create a preview URL, and anyone can access it.
2. Quick example: create preview URL (TS + Python CodeGroup)
3. **API reference:**
   - `sandbox.createPreviewURL({ port, domain?, authConfig? })`
   - `sandbox.listPreviewURLs()`
   - `sandbox.deletePreviewURL(port)`
4. **Custom domains:**
   - How to verify your domain
   - DNS setup (TXT for verification, CNAME for routing)
   - SSL is automatic
5. Preview URLs persist across hibernation/wake cycles
6. Examples: share a dev server, multiple ports, custom domain

### Reference (`reference/`)

These are exhaustive, lookup-oriented pages. No tutorials, no "why" — just every endpoint/method/type with parameters, return types, and a minimal example. The entity pages (Agents, Sandboxes) teach; these pages are the source of truth.

#### `reference/api.mdx` — NEW

### CLI Reference (KEEP, streamline)

CLI pages stay as a separate nav group. These are reference-only (no conceptual content — that lives in feature pages). Each page: flags table, output examples, practical one-liners.

#### `cli/overview.mdx` — REWRITE
- Installation (4 platforms)
- Configuration (`oc config set`)
- Resolution order (flags > env > config > defaults)
- Global flags
- JSON output mode

#### `cli/sandbox.mdx` — KEEP (minor edits)
#### `cli/exec.mdx` — RENAME from commands.mdx, update to match `oc exec` naming
#### `cli/shell.mdx` — KEEP (minor edits)
#### `cli/checkpoint.mdx` — MERGE current checkpoint + patch pages
#### `cli/preview.mdx` — RENAME from previews.mdx (singular)

**Deleted CLI pages:** `cli/patches.mdx` (merged into checkpoint)

---

### Guides (KEEP + minor edits)

#### `guides/build-a-lovable-clone.mdx` — KEEP
Good content. Minor edits:
- Update "Coming Soon" section (some features now exist: agent sessions, checkpoints)
- Ensure code examples use `sandbox.exec` not `sandbox.commands`

#### `guides/agent-skill.mdx` — KEEP
Minimal, functional. No changes needed.

---

### New Pages

#### `troubleshooting.mdx` — NEW

**Structure:**
1. Common errors:
   - `401 Unauthorized` → check API key, env var name
   - `Sandbox not found` → sandbox may have been killed or timed out
   - `Connection refused` → sandbox still creating, or hibernated
   - Timeout errors → increase timeout, check idle timeout
2. Debugging tips:
   - Check sandbox status with `sandbox.isRunning()`
   - Use `sandbox.exec.list()` to see running processes
   - Agent stderr via `onError` callback
3. Getting help: GitHub issues link, support channels

#### `changelog.mdx` — NEW (stub)

Placeholder page with latest version info and link to GitHub releases. Keep minimal — will grow organically.

---

## Audit: Plan vs Code (2026-03-11)

Cross-referenced the plan against exact TS SDK, Python SDK, and HTTP API handler source code. Issues grouped by severity.

### CRITICAL: Plan claims parity that doesn't exist

The plan assumes TS and Python SDKs are interchangeable. They are NOT. Several features exist in TypeScript but are missing from Python:

| Feature | TypeScript | Python | HTTP API |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| `Sandbox.create({ cpuCount, memoryMB })` | Yes | **NO** (not a param) | Yes |
| `sandbox.hibernate()` / `sandbox.wake()` | Yes | **NO** (methods don't exist) | Yes |
| `exec.start()` returns streaming `ExecSession` | Yes (WebSocket + callbacks) | **Returns `str` (session ID only)** | WebSocket available |
| `exec.attach(sessionId)` | Yes | **NO** (method doesn't exist) | WebSocket available |
| `maxRunAfterDisconnect` in exec | Yes | **NO** | Yes |
| Agent `resume` parameter | Yes (via `AgentConfig`) | **NO** (not in `start()` signature) | Yes |
| Agent `onExit` callback | Yes | **NO** | N/A |
| Agent `onScrollbackEnd` callback | Yes | **NO** | N/A |
| Exec `onScrollbackEnd` callback | Yes (in `ExecAttachOpts`) | **NO** | N/A |

**Impact on plan:** Every page that says "TS + Python CodeGroup" must handle these asymmetries. Can't just show identical code in two tabs for exec.start, hibernation, or agent resume. Options:
1. Show TS-only features clearly marked as such
2. Note Python gaps with "coming soon" or "use HTTP API directly"
3. File issues on the Python SDK to add missing features before docs ship

### Naming/type mismatches

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| `Templates` class name | TS exports `Templates` (plural). Python exports `Template` (singular). Plan uses `Template` — inconsistent with TS. |
| `Templates` not on Sandbox | Unlike `agent`, `exec`, `files`, `pty` — `Templates` is standalone (not `sandbox.templates`). Plan's reference section should reflect this. |
| `CheckpointInfo` fields | Plan says: `id, name, status, sandboxId, createdAt`. Actual TS: `id, sandboxId, orgId, name, rootfsS3Key?, workspaceS3Key?, sandboxConfig, status, sizeBytes, createdAt`. HTTP response: `checkpointID, sandboxID, includeMemory, sizeBytes, createdAt` (no `name`!). Needs reconciliation. |
| HTTP API uses `checkpointID`/`sandboxID` | SDK uses `id`/`sandboxId`. Plan must be clear about which is which per surface. |
| `ExecAttachOpts` type | TS has a separate type for attach (with `onScrollbackEnd`). Plan doesn't mention it. |
| `PatchInfo.strategy` field | Exists in type definition but never set by server. Unclear meaning. |

### Undocumented features (exist in code, not in plan)

| Feature | Where | Should go |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| `onScrollbackEnd` callback (agent + exec) | TS SDK | agents/events.mdx, sandboxes/running-commands.mdx |
| `POST /api/sandboxes/:sandboxId/save-as-template` | HTTP API | sandboxes/templates.mdx, reference/api.mdx |
| Python `PtySession.recv()` method | Python SDK | sandboxes/interactive-terminals.mdx, reference/python-sdk.mdx |
| Python `Sandbox` async context manager (`async with`) | Python SDK | sandboxes/overview.mdx, reference/python-sdk.mdx |
| WebSocket binary protocol (stream markers 0x00-0x04) | Both SDKs internally, HTTP API | reference/api.mdx (essential for raw API users) |
| Dual auth model (API key for control plane, JWT for worker) | HTTP API | reference/api.mdx |
| `POST /api/sandboxes/:id/token/refresh` | Worker HTTP API | reference/api.mdx |
| HTTP create sandbox extra params: `alias`, `port`, `networkEnabled`, `imageRef`, `templateRootfsKey`, `templateWorkspaceKey` | HTTP API | reference/api.mdx (some may be internal-only) |
| Create sandbox response: `connectURL`, `token`, `clientID`, `hostPort`, `machineID` | HTTP API | reference/api.mdx |
| Python `AgentEvent.__getitem__` / `.get()` dict-like access | Python SDK | reference/python-sdk.mdx |
| Python `commands.py` legacy file still exists (deprecated) | Python SDK | Note in reference, don't document |
| PTY `shell` param in HTTP create body | HTTP API | reference/api.mdx |
| PTY resize endpoint | HTTP API + CLI | sandboxes/interactive-terminals.mdx |
| `ExecSessionInfo.attachedClients` field | Both SDKs | reference pages |

### Plan references things that don't exist or are wrong

| Claim in plan | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "Sandbox.create({ ... cpuCount, memoryMB })" for Python | Python `create()` doesn't accept these params |
| "sandbox.hibernate(), sandbox.wake()" for both SDKs | Python SDK doesn't have these methods |
| "sandbox.exec.attach()" as available in both | Python has no `attach()` on Exec |
| "resume param" documented for both SDKs | Python Agent.start() has no `resume` param |
| Agent HTTP API has WebSocket streaming | There's no WebSocket endpoint for agents — SDKs use exec sessions internally. Agent events are SDK-abstracted. |
| Plan says HTTP auth is `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` | Control plane uses API key middleware; worker uses sandbox-scoped JWT. Two different auth flows. |

### Recommended fixes to plan

1. **Add "SDK parity" column to all feature tables.** Where Python is missing a feature, clearly mark it TS-only and show the HTTP API alternative.
2. **Fix reference/api.mdx auth section.** Document both auth flows (API key for `/api/*` on control plane, Bearer JWT for direct worker access).
3. **Add WebSocket protocol section to reference/api.mdx.** Binary frame format with stream markers is essential for anyone not using an SDK.
4. **Add `saveAsTemplate` to templates page and API reference.**
5. **Fix CheckpointInfo structure** to match actual code across all three surfaces.
6. **Add Python-specific features** to reference/python-sdk.mdx: context manager, `recv()`, `collect_events()`, `AgentEvent` dict-like access.
7. **Don't document `PatchInfo.strategy`** until it's actually used.
8. **Note `Templates`/`Template` naming difference** in reference pages.

## Execution Order

### Phase 1: Entity overview pages (do first — everything else references these)
1. Create `agents/overview.mdx` (the headline entity — most users start here)
2. Create `sandboxes/overview.mdx` (the foundational primitive)
3. Rewrite `introduction.mdx` (links to agents + sandboxes)
4. Rewrite `quickstart.mdx`

### Phase 2: Agent sub-pages
5. Create `agents/events.mdx`
6. Create `agents/tools.mdx`
7. Create `agents/multi-turn.mdx`

### Phase 3: Sandbox sub-entity and operation pages
8. Rewrite `sandboxes/running-commands.mdx` (merge TS + Python exec pages)
9. Rewrite `sandboxes/working-with-files.mdx` (merge TS + Python filesystem pages)
10. Create `sandboxes/interactive-terminals.mdx` (promote from SDK-only)
11. Rewrite `sandboxes/checkpoints.mdx` (entity page: concept + API)
12. Rewrite `sandboxes/templates.mdx` (entity page: concept + API)
13. Rewrite `sandboxes/patches.mdx` (entity page: concept + API)
14. Create `sandboxes/preview-urls.mdx` (entity page: concept + API)

### Phase 4: Reference Pages
15. Create `reference/api.mdx` (HTTP API — derived from router.go)
16. Create `reference/typescript-sdk.mdx` (derived from sdks/typescript/src/)
17. Create `reference/python-sdk.mdx` (derived from sdks/python/opencomputer/)

### Phase 5: CLI + Support Pages
18. Rewrite `cli/overview.mdx`
19. Update `cli/sandbox.mdx`
20. Create `cli/exec.mdx` (rename from commands)
21. Update `cli/shell.mdx`
22. Create `cli/checkpoint.mdx` (merge checkpoint + patch)
23. Create `cli/preview.mdx` (rename from previews)
24. Create `troubleshooting.mdx`
25. Create `changelog.mdx` (stub)

### Phase 6: Cleanup
26. Update `guides/build-a-lovable-clone.mdx` (minor fixes)
27. Delete all `sdks/` pages
28. Delete old root-level feature pages (agents.mdx, running-commands.mdx, working-with-files.mdx)
29. Delete obsolete CLI pages
30. Update `mint.json` with new navigation

## Page Count Summary

| Section | Current | Proposed | Delta |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Getting Started | 2 | 2 | 0 |
| Agents | 1* | 4 | +3 |
| Sandboxes | 2* | 8 | +6 |
| Reference | 0 | 3 | +3 |
| CLI | 7 | 6 | -1 |
| Guides | 2 | 2 | 0 |
| Resources | 0 | 2 | +2 |
| SDK (tabs) | 16 | 0 | -16 |
| **Total** | **30** | **27** | **-3** |

*Current agents.mdx + running-commands.mdx + working-with-files.mdx exist at root level without clear grouping.

Net result: 3 fewer pages. Entity pages teach with curated examples; Reference pages are exhaustive lookup. Zero duplication between SDK tabs.

---

## Quality Bar

Each page must pass these checks before shipping:
- [ ] Opens with a working code example (not prose)
- [ ] Code examples use tabs (TypeScript / Python / HTTP API) where applicable
- [ ] HTTP API tab included for operations that map cleanly to a single endpoint
- [ ] Streaming/WebSocket operations can omit HTTP tab (SDK-only is fine)
- [ ] No deprecated API names (`commands` → `exec`)
- [ ] All parameters documented match actual SDK code
- [ ] No "coming soon" for features that now exist
- [ ] No filler sentences ("In this section we will..." — just do it)
- [ ] Cross-links to reference pages for full method signatures
- [ ] CLI equivalent noted where applicable
